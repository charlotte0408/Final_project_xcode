# QT_CORE Implementation 

* This is the Core implementation process of my project. 

## Learning process for QT_Core part 
* Starting from implementing the **Tile**
    * These two classes are easy because tile is a class with a private data field: int and qtile inherits from the tile class by adding a draw function
    * Implement the board class: The most essential one and it is the class where the core algorithm lives
    * **QVector**
